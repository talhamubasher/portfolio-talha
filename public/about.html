<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Despite being fond of solitude and nature, I have had my share of digital immersion.
    This has enabled me to understand the digital lingo and content, similar to my fellow Gen-Zers, 
    but with an eye for details and aesthetics. </br> </br>Two years ago, I was doing gigs here and there. 
    But right now, I'm sticking to the same field of work, namely: education and training. 
    But that period brought me tons of experience across platforms. 
    Although I admit that I'm not an expert, I know how to get stuff up and running. <br></br>
    I have a knack for doing things in a different way, especially when it comes to writing.<br></br>
    You can see everything that I have done with capital value, if you scroll down. Hopefully.<br></p>
